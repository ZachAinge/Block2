CS 3090 (Ethics in Computing) Block 2 Project Repository

Occasionally, I like to design fonts in my free time. So this repository is meant to hold those in an open space, and potentially be used in others' projects. 
In the future, I may expand this repository (or create an entirely new sister repository) to hold my other art projects. These could include sprites, backgrounds, animations, etc. ideally meant for games and similar projects but not necessarily confined to those fields.
